1. Create global dictionary/namespace. All jinja files need to be passed global namespace variables!
2. Job consists of
    a. Class w/ main function that returns a list w/ (name,func). These define the sub-steps similar to hammer
    b. files directory (can contain anything. Schemata, templates, etc...)
    c. parameters.yml (lists the required parameters, optional parameters labeled explicitly as optional)
3. Add placeholder tests for every utility function. In fact, create a utility package in pysilicon folder
4. Create a bin folder to contain things like scan_generator, etc...
5. Transition pysilicon to a command line argument similar to hammer...
6. Need to rename pysilicon... This is a more general project than hammer
7. Bootstrap w/ Make but add doit and other build systems as Jobs
